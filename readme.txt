This is an Arduino project which is intended to sound an alarm (like
a car alarm) and blink a light (intended to be at the edge of a piece
of plexiglasÂ with a message ground in so the message lights up from
internal reflections) when someone comes too close to the piece. Of
course the piece has small details to attract people close to it.

Requires an LED, speaker, and ultrasonic range finder.
